      <p>The Eagles are more determined than ever to get younger and thus, less expensive. The Eagles have already shown this through a season that so far has not lived up to expectations even though they&rsquo;re in first place in a weak NFC East.</p>
    <p>And they will have to make some tough decisions.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s because the Eagles are projected to be way over the salary cap next season, and they have several veterans with big contracts. That includes star players such as quarterback Carson Wentz, tight end Zach Ertz, wide receivers DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery, and defensive linemen Brandon Graham and Fletcher Cox.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s clear that not all of them can return. In the meantime, mainly because of injuries, some young players have gotten an opportunity and made the most of it, while some others have not.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s still the second half of the season remaining, and a playoff berth if the Eagles hold on to win the NFC East.</p>
    <p>For now, here is your chance to weigh in on who should return or not:</p>
